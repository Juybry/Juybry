### How is it going?
If you are reading this is because you have more interest in me or we are just collaborating, in any case, you know my name (Bryan Lucero) and nickname (Juybry).  
### My work?
Well, currently I have a background in CCS, HTML and JS, I left pinned a couple of projects in which I worked in these areas. Generally, currently, I am still studying more areas of opportunities and as they say: “A good teacher never stops learning”.
### Anything else?
Well, generally these last few years I have focused on my biggest weaknesses, soft skills, a couple of years in theater where I got a lot of experience in public speaking and voice management, some classes to get the basics of the SCRUM methodology and so a couple of situations where I was given the basics to be a team leader.
### Fun fact?
If I could have been anything other than a systems engineer, I would have loved to be a fashion designer or a chef.
